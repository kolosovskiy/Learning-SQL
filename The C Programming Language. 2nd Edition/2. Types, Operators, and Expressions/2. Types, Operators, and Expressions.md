Basic data types:
- **char** - a single byte, capable of holding one character in the local character set.
- **int** - an integer, typically reflecting the natural size of integers on the host machine.
- **float** - single-precision floating point.
- **double** - double-precision floating point.

The qualifiers `short` and `long` may be applied to integers:
```
short int sh;
long int counter;
```
The word int can be omitted in such declarations

The qualifier signed or unsigned may be applied to char or integers.

The standard headers <limits.h> and <float.h> contain symbolic constants 
for all of these sizes, along with other properties of the machine and compiler.

**Literals**:

- Suffix U or u - unsigned
- Suffix L or l - long
- Suffix f or F - float
- A decimal point (123.4) or an exponent (1e-2) or both indicates float

```
123 // int
123u // unsigned int
123UL // unsigned long int
123.4 // float
123.4f // float
2e2 // float. calculations: 2 * 10 ^ 2 = 200.000000
2e-2 // float. calculations: 2 * 10 ^ -2 = 0.020000
```

An integer too big to fit into an int will also be taken as a long.

The value of an integer can be specified in octal or hexadecimal instead of decimal:
- Leading 0 (zero) means octal
- Leading Ox or ox means hexadecimal

Representations of 31: 
```
31 // decimal (default)
037 // octal
Ox1f // hex
0X1F // hex
0x1FUL // hex, unsigned long
```

A character constant is an integer, written as one character within single
quotes, such as 'x'. The value of a character constant is the numeric value of
the character in the machine's character set. In the ASCII character 
set the character constant '0' has the value 48, which is unrelated to the
numeric value O. Character constants participate in numeric operations just as
any other integers.
```
'0' == 48 // true in ASCII
```

Certain characters can be represented in character and string constants by escape sequences:
- \a alert (bell) character
- \b backspace
- \f formfeed
- \n newline
- \r carriage return
- \t horizontal tab
- \v vertical tab
- \\ backslash
- \? question mark
- \' single quote
- \" double ,quote

In addition, an arbitrary byte-sized bit pattern can be specified by
- '\000' where 000 is one to three octal digits (0...7) 
- '\xhh' where hh is one or more hexadecimal digits (0 ... 9, a ... f, A ..F)

`\v` the same as `\013` the same as `\xb` in ASCII
