When a goto statement is encountered in a C program, the control jumps directly to the label mentioned in the goto statement.
Syntax:
```
label:   
//some part of the code;   
goto label;  
```
However, using goto is avoided these days since it makes the program less readable and complicated.
The only condition in which using goto is preferable is when we need to break the multiple loops using a single statement at the same time:
```
int main() {  
  int i, j, k;

  for (i=0; i<10; i++) {
    for (j=0; j<5; j++) {
      for (k=0; k<3; k++) {
        printf("%d %d %d\n", i, j, k);

        if (j == 3) { 
          goto out;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  out:
  printf("came out of the loop");   
}
```
