Normally you are at liberty to give functions whatever
names you like, but "main" is special-your program begins executing at the
beginning of main. This means that every program must have a main some-
where.

`#include <stdio.h>` tells the compiler to include information about the standard input/output library

A sequence of characters in double quotes, like "hello, world\n", is
called a **character string or string constant**.

**An escape sequence** like
\n provides a general and extensible mechanism for representing hard-to-type
or invisible characters.

In C, all variables must be declared before they are used, usually at the
beginning of the function before any executable statements. A declaration
announces the properties of variables; it consists of a type name and a list of
variables, such as
`int fahr, celsius;`

As in many other languages, integer division truncates: any fractional part is discarded. So:
5/9 would be truncated to 0
4/3 would be truncated to 1
