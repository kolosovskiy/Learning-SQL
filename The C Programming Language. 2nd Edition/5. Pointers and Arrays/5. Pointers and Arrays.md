A **pointer** is a variable that contains the address of a variable.
Let us begin with a simplified picture of how memory is organized. A typical machine has an array of consecutively numbered or addressed memory cells that may bemanipulated individually or in contiguous groups. One common situationisthatanybytecanbeachar,apairofone-bytecellscanbetreated as a short integer, and four adjacent bytes form a long. A pointer is a group of cells (often two or four) that can hold an address.
The unary operator & gives the address of an object, so the statement
```
p = &c;
```
assigns the address of `c` to the variable `p`, and `p` is said to "point to" `c`. The `&` operator only applies to objects in memory: variables and array elements. It cannot be applied to expressions, constants, or register variables.
