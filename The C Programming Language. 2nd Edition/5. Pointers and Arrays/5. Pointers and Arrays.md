A **pointer** is a variable that contains the address of a variable.
Let us begin with a simplified picture of how memory is organized. A typical machine has an array of consecutively numbered or addressed memory cells that may bemanipulated individually or in contiguous groups. One common situationisthatanybytecanbeachar,apairofone-bytecellscanbetreated as a short integer, and four adjacent bytes form a long. A pointer is a group of cells (often two or four) that can hold an address.
The unary operator & gives the address of an object, so the statement
```
p = &c;
```
assigns the address of `c` to the variable `p`, and `p` is said to "point to" `c`. The `&` operator only applies to objects in memory: variables and array elements. It cannot be applied to expressions, constants, or register variables.
The unary operator `*` is the indirection or dereferencing operator; when
applied to a pointer, it accesses the object the pointer points to.
```
	int x = 1, y = 2, z[10];
	int *ip; // declare a pointer to int 

	ip = &x; // ip now points to x 
	y = *ip; // y is now 1 
	*ip = 0; // x is now 0 
	ip = &z[0]; // ip now points to z[0] 
	z[0] = 7; // z[0] is now 7 
	*ip = 8; // z[0] is now 8 

	printf("x: %d, y: %d, z[0]: %d\n", x, y, *ip); // x: 0, y: 1, z[0]: 8
	printf("%d\n", *ip == z[0]); // 1
	printf("%d\n", ip == &z[0]); // 1
```
