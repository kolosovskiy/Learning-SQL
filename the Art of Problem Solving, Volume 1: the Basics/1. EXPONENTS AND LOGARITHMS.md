Exponent is  a simple way of writing repeated multiplication

In an expression like 2^5, the 2 is called the **base** and the 5 is the **exponent** or **power**

When we multiply two expressions with the same base, we add their exponents, and when we divide two expressions with the same base we subtract exponents:

`2^5 * 2^6 = 2^11 = 2048`

`3^15 / 3^12 = 3^3 = 27`

A negative exponent means the extra numbers are in the denominator:

`3^6 / 3^8 = 3^-2 = 1 / 3^2 = 1 / 9`

Any nonzero number raised to the zero power equals 1

`3^3 / 3^3 = 3^(3-3) = 3^0 = 1`

Zero raised to any negative power or null is undefined

Null raised to any positive power is always 0

When an exponential expression is raised to a power, we multiply the exponent of the expression by the power to which the expression is raised:

`(2^3)^5 = 2^15`

### Exercise 1.1
1. `3^4 = 3 * 3 * 3 * 3 = 81`
2. `(2^5)(2^2) = 2^7 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 = 128`
3. `(5^-3)(5^5)(5^-1) = 5^1 = 5`
4. `4^3 / 4 = 4^2 = 16`
5. `2^7 / 2^2 = 2^5 = 32`
6. `((3^4)(3^-2)) / ((3^5)(3^-2)) = 3^2 / 3^3 = 3^-1 = 1 / 3`
7. `(2^5)(3^2)(2^-3) = (2^2)(3^2) = 36`
8. `(5^2)(3^-1)(2^4)(5^-1)(2^-2) = (5^1)(3^-1)(2^2) = 5 * (1 / 3) * 4 = 20 / 3`
