### Chapter 1. Making decisions
1. I will train my ability to decide quickly. I will imagine that there is a "decision muscle"
which becomes stronger with every decision that I make. (There are people who study the
menu for fifteen minutes and then end up ordering spaghetti Bolognese.) Today I will
undertake to decide within thirty seconds what I want to eat and drink. I will do this
regardless of the danger that I might have to eat something that I do not like. I will make
every small decision today within thirty seconds.
2. With every decision, I will ask myself: What are the consequences if I decide in that way?
Will my decision make me and those around me happy? In this way I will learn to listen to
myself.
3. I will answer the following questions in writing: Who will I be in five years? What will I
be doing in five years? What will I have in five years? All of my decisions will be gearedto these goals. I am prepared to sever myself from that which I basically do not like. In this
manner, I will have both hands free for my dreams.

### Chapter 2. As Soon As Possible
1. In the morning I will ask myself, " What do I not like doing?" These are the tasks that I will
tackle first. I will do this so that the unpleasant tasks do not start to burden me
unnecessarily. The quicker I finish, the better my day will be because then I will only have
pleasant tasks ahead.
2. The next question I will ask myself this morning is, "What is my most important task
today?" I will immediately begin to tackle it and not let myself be distracted by anything
until that objective is accomplished. Even if I do not accomplish anything else today, I will
know that I have accomplished the most important task.
3. I will ask myself: " What can I change in my life so that I have more time for important
duties instead of having to take care of tasks which have become urgent?"
4. Whatever I decide to undertake, I will begin doing it within 72 hours. I will at least take
the first step. I will make a sport of surprising everyone with my quickness. I will act
today according to the principle of a.s.a.p.

### Chapter 3. Concentrate on the IPA's
1. I will reflect on how I spent my time yesterday. I will make myself aware that not much
will change if I do not concretely plan my IPA's.
2. I will ask myself what I can do concretely to work more in the areas that determine my
income.
3. I understand that perfectionism is often only a decision to hesitate. I will therefore
concentrate of doing tasks faster rather than doing them perfectly.

### Chapter 4. SINALOA
1. I will discover how many IPA's in my business that I must carry out within a week in order
to be on the very safe side. As soon as I know the number, I will decide to have SINALOA
work for me for a period of three months.
2. If I happen to find myself in a winter period in my business, I will be aware that with
every winter day that passes, that I will automatically be one step closer to summer. The
more I work now, the quicker summer will arrive.
3. If I am currently experiencing a summer period, then I know that winter is approaching. I
know that it is time to reap the harvest. Therefore, I will double my efforts. I will decide
not to let any winter divert me from my goals.
4. In order to endure the winter successfully, one must carefully prepare. I will decide to
read one chapter per day of this book. In addition, I will decide to attend seminars to grow
as a personality.

### Chapter 5. The Past Is Not the Same as the Future
1. I will take a time-out today. It will be a time of reflection. I will sit quietly down
somewhere or take a slow walk. I will find peace and listen to my inner voice.
2. I will lean back and think about how much has happened in the past seven years of my life.
What have I learned, how much I have accomplished, how much I have acquired, and how
many people I have met? How has my personality developed and what have I experienced
in this time? I will make myself aware that just as much can happen in the next seven
years.
3. I will ask myself: "If I really had the choice, what would I willingly do and be? What are
my dreams? Who will I be in seven years and what will I be doing? " I will write down
my thoughts on the subject. It can help me if I ask myself what I would really love to do
and what corresponds to my talents?
4. I will admit that I really do have the choice. It depends on me. I can create a life at any
time that is worthy of me tomorrow. I am the designer of my life. I have the courage to behappy.
 
### Chapter 6. A Person Becomes Someone through His Work
1. I consider my job and my company as the vehicle to a successful personality and to
improved circumstances. Therefore, I will work with great energy and enthusiasm. I will
do my utmost to become something - via my work.
2. I will attend every educational course or further development seminar offered by my
company. Independent of that I will attend four seminars per year that are not limited to
what I do professionally.
3. I will read literature that will strengthen me as a person. Today, I will exchange television
time for reading time. Today, I will read a non-fiction book for at least one hour.
4. I will think about how I will benefit when I have achieved a high goal in my company. Iwill also reflect on who among the people dear to me will benefit from this. Today I will
make a list of all of the advantages.
 
### Chapter 7. Dealing with Rejection
1. Today I will record every success in writing. I will not only ask myself what I have
accomplished exceedingly well, but also why it went so well. Today, I will buy an empty
book that I will call my Success Journal.
2. I will immediately strike off every rejection like sand. I understand that some people have
made it their life's aim to be negative. I will accept this and not take it personally.
3. I know that I cannot change the world. I will therefore concentrate on those aspects that I
can control: I will enhance the quality of my person and concentrate on my attitude.
4. Today, I will converse only with people who discuss successes and positive facts. As
soon as anyone starts speaking about something negative, I will walk away. Also, today, I
will only express the positive. I am aware that rejection exists. I also know, however, that
it would be senseless to give more power to this rejection by talking about it.

### Chapter 8. Do Not "Re-Invent" the Wheel
1. I will orient myself according to the strategies of the successful people in my field. As
long as I do not regularly achieve the results that I desire, I will follow the proven
strategies.
2. I will check whether I am in the teenager stage in any area of my life. This would work
against my claim to constantly grow. I will then immediately do everything in order to
become willing to learn again.
3. I will determine what the fundamentals are in my field. I will then write a detailed action
plan for each of these activities. I will make an effort to note every step, even the smallestof them. I will discuss this action plan with a person who is very successful in my field. I
will strictly adhere to the action plans that result therefrom.
4. When something does not work, then I will not alter the fundamentals, as I realize that I
must make changes in myself.

### Chapter 9. Momentum
1. I will make a conscious decision, to work for as long as it takes with every possible effort
to gain momentum. I understand that this is economical and smart. A car starts moving
much easier if it has first been pushed.
2. Today, I will work with the best possible discipline, for I am aware that discipline is the
key to gaining momentum.
3. I will not look so much at the results, for I know that these will come automatically once I
have gained enough momentum. I will also not wait for better circumstances, for I know
that it is the momentum that will first create these conditions.
4. I will make a list of the areas in which I have developed momentum. (Some people have
built momentum in griping and complaining, in eating sweets, in spending absurd amounts
of money...) Momentum works for me and also against me. I will write down which areas
next to my job that I want to develop momentum: Sports, eating habits, family life, reading,
dealing with money...

### Chapter 10. Give 110 percent
1. Today, I will give 110 percent by at least three activities that I practice. This means that
even if I think I cannot do more, I will give it that last added effort.
2. Today, I will not accept any limits. 100 percent is a fictitious idea of my performance
level that does not correspond to reality. I want to become that best that I can be. When I
cannot, I must.
3. As the picture that I have of myself does not correspond to reality, I can replace it with the
picture of whom I would like to be. This picture does not allow limits. Today, I will write
down how I would like to be and then I will envisage being so already. I will also behave
accordingly.

### Chapter 11. Dealing with Problems
1. As soon as a problem arises, I will immediately concentrate on its solution. I will
immediately read the six steps to solving problems.
2. I will be aware that I am probably not the first person to have this problem. I will look for
role models who have successfully conducted themselves in a similar situation and I will
learn from them.
3. I understand that the true problem is how I view the problem. It is similar to pancakes.
Every pancake has something in common: It has two sides. There is always a light side
and a darker side. Therefore, with all of my problems today, I will ask myself: What is
beneficial about this problem?
4. I know that I grow by means of problems. I will therefore not avoid them. Each time that I
overcome one, I will seek out the next challenge. I will make a sport out of dealing with
problems.

### Chapter 12. Down Time
1. I understand that no building should be built without a sound foundation. Therefore, I am
very active with regard to momentum and maintain my daily work methods. However, I am
patient with regard to my results. I know that every large building has been built stone by
stone.
2. Regardless what happens: I will not give up. I know that each time I do not carry out my
intention, I will have acknowledged defeat. Therefore, today, I will do everything that I set
out to do. Today I will see everything to completion.
3. I will bet on the great victories instead of on the small wins. I will not set too high goals
for next year, but will exert 110 percent. I will know no limits for the next decade. Today I
will think about whether I should set my ten-year goal even higher.

### Chapter 13. Every Distraction Is the Same
1. I recognize that every distraction is the same with regard to the result. Therefore, today, I
will not let anything or anybody distract me from my schedule.
2. From today on, I will never make excuses. They only serve to distract me. I want to have
power over my life and do not want to be the playing ball of whatever circumstances.
Using excuses signifies that I am giving up the power over my life to circumstances or
other people. I want to use my energy to achieve my goal and not to find excuses.
3. As I can always depend on unforeseen distractions, I will plan out some time for such
occasions. I will thus affirm that distractions have to conform to me and not vice versa.

### Chapter 14. Taking Full Responsibility
1. Today I will not place the blame on anyone or on any circumstances. To whom I give the
blame, I give the power. I want to be the master of my life.
2. When I become tempted to find a situation too difficult, I will close my eyes and think of a
person who is especially strong. I will then ask myself what this person would think of this
situation and how he would deal with it.
3. If I do not achieve my goal today, I will assume responsibility for that. Just as I will take
the responsibility when I succeed very well with an accomplishment. I will not make luck
or other people who have assisted me responsible. Rather, I will feel proud and happy
about my success. In this manner I will actively enhance my self-confidence.

### Chapter 15. Dissatisfaction Is Beneficial
1. I will say out loud a minimum of five things for which I have to be grateful. Each time that
I concentrate on doing this exercise, my fear disappears.
2. I will stand by my dissatisfaction, for it is a decisive and propelling force within me.
Satisfaction lulls one to sleep and leads to a slow death. Dissatisfaction produces
greatness and allows one to really live.
3. I know that I can only grow in my profession when I can make others enthusiastic about
working with me. Therefore, today, I will look out for dissatisfied people to whom I can
offer a good opportunity.

### Chapter 16. Give and Forgive
1. I will bless everyone whom I meet, to whom I speak on the phone or of whom I am
thinking and wish him or her joy, happiness, health and fun. I will extend positive energy
to him or her.
2. I will bring a gift for everyone whom I visit today. I will bring him or her something
material, good wishes, well-thought out compliments or an idea. All of this will
demonstrate that I am seriously interested in his or her well-being. I will practice and
demonstrate abundance.
3. Today I will give an extraordinarily well thought-out gift to the people dearest to me. I
will do this because I simply want to enjoy his or her happiness.
4. Today I will grant forgiveness. I will make this gift above all to myself. I will think about
the person against whom I hold a grudge. I will forgive this person in my heart. I will then
call this person or write a letter to him or her today - immediately would be best. Today I
will not think negatively about anyone. By doing this I will be freeing myself.

### Chapter 17. Dealing with Fear
1. As soon as I become "overtaken" by fear, I will immediately read the ten points on dealing
with it.
2. I will immediately write down at least five aspects for which I am grateful. I understand
that fear is not something arbitrary; rather, I decide what I make out of it. I can outshine it
with gratefulness whenever I so desire.
3. Today I will assume another way of looking at fear. I will recognize it as a useful
propellant to my success. A small amount of fear shows me that I am extending myself and
growing. When I would not be afraid of the next step, then I would know that the step is
too insignificant.
4. Today I will consider myself in the total context of the infinite cosmos. Moreover I will
make myself aware that all of my fears and disasters are nothing more than a teenyweeny
waft of air in the cosmos of time. I know that life is a game. This perception will help me
to not take myself and my fears too seriously.

### Chapter 18. Make Friends
Spiritualize the following golden rules for the respectful and loving way to deal with each
other:
1. Encourage others whenever you can. Praise successes, even the small ones, and play down
mistakes.
2. Always give others the opportunity to keep face. Never expose or denigrate anyone.
3. Only speak positively of others when they are not present. If you have nothing positive to
say then remain silent.
4. Give recognition and praise whenever possible. Praise is like sunshine. Without it we
cannot grow. You can never have enough praise. Substantiate the praise precisely so that it
does not sound like flattery.
5. If you want someone to improve, then act as if that person already possesses these
characteristics. He will subsequently make every effort not to disappoint you.
6. Criticize as little as possible and if possible, do it indirectly. Never attack the person but
rather the action. Demonstrate tot the other that you truly like him and want to help him.
Never criticize in writing.
7. Admit some weaknesses. Make yourself small. Give others the opportunity to feel big. If
you want to make enemies, outdo others; if you want to make friends, let yourself be
outdone.
8. If you have behaved badly, apologize. If you expect a dressing down, approach the other
first and give yourself the dressing down first.
9. Make suggestions rather than giving orders. Instead of provoking resistance, promote
teamwork.
10. Give others sympathy and attention - they thirst for it. React with understanding to the
anger of others. Anger is often a cry for attention.
11. Appeal to the noble sentiments and motives of people. Everyone gladly wants to consider
himself magnanimous and selfless.
12. Talk sparingly. Give the other person the opportunity to speak and be a good listener.
13. Let the other person believe that the idea came from him. It is a good idea regardless of
who came up with it. And everyone would prefer to believe that they have acted according
to their own ideas. Oceans are the kings of all streams because they can keep themselves
low so well.
14. Do not interrupt the other even if you feel he is in the wrong. He will not listen to you as
long as he has something on his mind.
15. Try to look at things from the other's point of view. First always put yourself in the other's
shoes and ask yourself: Why is he acting like that? Understanding everything signifies
forgiveness.
16. Never make an effort to be right. Be smarter but do not act so. Admit that you may be
mistaken, that will make any argument impossible.
17. Never enter a discussion without having a clear goal or a concise idea of what you aregoing to say.
18. Always try by being friendly. With a drop of honey you can capture a lot more bees than
with a pot full of bile.
19. Be happy with opposition. Use self-control. First listen sincerely then look for agreement.
Be critical of yourself. Promise to think it over and thank him the person for the
suggestion. And, postpone the decision.
20. Be sincerely interested in the other person. Make it your motto to be interested rather than
interesting.
21. Smile. No one needs a smile as much as the person who does not care about others.
22. Always speak to the other person with his full name. That demonstrates respect. Everyone
appreciates hearing his own name - much more so than a name substitute. Naturally, you
have to take note of the names.
23. Elicit a sincere need in the other. Learn to look at situations from the other's point of view.
Ask yourself: What is the advantage for the other person?
24. Take every precaution in every discussion (also by phone) that you make the other person
feel better: first, towards himself and second, towards his company, and third, towards
you.

Practice:
1. I will be aware that love is the most intelligent, economical and energy saving way to
attain a goal. I will therefore decide to give people what they need.
2. Today I will live according to the golden rules. I know that if I would like to make them an
integral part of my life, I must read them once a day. Therefore I will now make a
conscious decision to always carry these golden rules with me and to read them daily - at
best before every important discussion.
3. I will find that after having lived for a time according to the golden rules that a change has
taken place in me. I will begin truly to like more and more people. The golden rules are
then no longer a means to an end; they will have become rather an end in itself and an
inner need.

### Chapter 19. Boss and Employee in One Person
1. Freedom is not being able to do or not do what I desire; rather it is having the discipline to
accomplish what I have set out to do. I know that my success as a self-employed person
depends on whether I can summon up this discipline. I will force myself to develop this
trait. Every single detail is important. Today I will meticulously adhere to all of my plans.
2. I will decide to be both the boss and the employee in one. I will be hard on myself. I will
control myself like a boss would do his employee. I do not see why I should work harder
for someone else than for myself. I know that if I cannot control myself, then others will
control me. Either I can listen to myself or I have to listen to others.
3. At the end of every work day, I will critically review my results. As I, like everyone else,
have the tendency to lie to myself, I will write down all of my results, IPA's, and
preparations.
4. Because no one can be disciplined for the span of his entire life, I will plan a "loaf around
day" every two weeks. On this day I will do what I want, eat what I want, sleep as long as
I desire...I will take a vacation from discipline and that is completely all right because I
have planned it such. On the other days, however, I will be totally disciplined. If I should
be in danger of getting weak, I will remember that the next "loaf around day" is around the
corner. This will give me the strength to be disciplined.

### Chapter 20. The Danger of Setting Goals That Are Too Modest
1. I am aware that nothing in my life has more influence than my long-term goals. The higher
the goals are, the more exciting and more rich my life will be. High goals will cause me to
make the best out of my life.
2. Therefore I will think about whether I should set my long-term goals even higher. By doing
so, I can only win. I will not teach this to people who do not understand this concept, for I
will only cultivate useless discussions. Rather I will think about who can help me attain
my goal.
3. As these goals would be too abstract, I will start a photo album in which I will paste all of
my dreams in the form of pictures that I cut out of magazines. If I look at it daily, achieving
my goals will become an absolute MUST.
4. I will set my short-term goals so that I can always attain them with effort. In this manner I
will fortify my self-confidence for higher goals. I will therefore determine which two
goals I will achieve in this week without fail and which goal I will attain this month
without fail.

### Chapter 21. Frustration Barriers
1. Today I will not give up in any circumstance. I know that there are many ways to
surrender. Therefore, today, I will carry out everything that I intend. When I cannot, I must.
2. It is possible that I might not welcome barriers at first sight in the beginning. However, at
second thought I realize that barriers represent the material with which I can build my
stairs to success in my life. With each barrier I therefore recognize with joy that it is my
opportunity for growth.
3. I will speak as quickly as possible to a winner who has already mastered a similar barrier
and will ask him for advice.
4. I will write down which barriers I have already overcome. In this way I will gain
confidence for the future. I determine that only I can make the decision how I deal with
barriers. They are not holding me back; my attitude towards them is.

### Chapter 22. Play with the Cards That You Have
1. I am aware that my success does not depend on the cards that I have but rather on whether
I live according to the laws of the winners. Therefore, I will not quarrel with my destiny.
2. I will make a list of my strengths and weaknesses. I will find a solution for my
weaknesses. I will concentrate on expanding my strengths by surrounding myself with
people who can further me.
3. I will look at my cards for the game of life. I will reflect on my entire situation and think
about what I can change. I will then draw up a plan actually to change these things. I am
decision happy and consistent in carrying these changes out. I will not postpone doing
what can be done. Instead I will do them immediately.
4. I will resign myself to the fact that I cannot change certain aspects. I will also smile today
even if it is raining for I know that if I do not laugh, it will still be raining.

### Chapter 23. The Four Phases of Management
1. Today I will ensure that I remain in the production phase.
2. I will draw up a plan that will help me to produce at least one concrete moneymaking
result every three days. Starting today, I will adhere to the Three-Day Rule.
3. In order to support my new employees optimally, I will encourage them in some way and
have contact with them at least once every three days. Co-workers need this support until
they, too, can live according to the Three-Day Rule. However, even after that time it can
also only be advantageous to continue to have some kind of contact with them every three
days.
4. Managing by example belongs to one of my most important management tasks. I will ask
myself today: Would I, too, want to begin working with me?

### Chapter 24. Health
1. Today I will be careful of what I eat. That means that I will consume less and at a slower
pace. I will pay attention to what I take and will chew more slowly and more thoroughly.
Today I will eat some fruit and a large salad. If I get hungry for snacks then I will buy nuts
and fruit.
2. Today I will drink a few glasses of water. If I do this especially before I eat, it will
prevent me from gorging on ridiculously large portions of food.
3. Today, I will run for at least 35 minutes. However, I will run so sensibly that it will be fun.
As soon as it becomes too strenuous, I will start walking for a while. I do not have to
prove anything to anybody. In this way I will find jogging enjoyable.
4. Today I will interrupt my work every 90 minutes to take a break and move around. I will
walk for five minutes in the fresh air or do a few fitness exercises. In this manner, I will
have more energy and better concentration. Altogether, I will accomplish so much more.

### Chapter 25. Finances
1. Starting today I will save at least ten percent of my net salary, for I know that only the
money that I save will make me wealthy. Moreover, I will set aside a certain percentage
for taxes.
2. As a self-employed person I will strictly separate my company expenses from my private
ones by establishing two different bank accounts. I will pay myself a fixed salary that I
will transfer from my company- to my private account. I will learn to live on a maximumof 45 percent of my profits.
3. I will subscribe to a financial trade journal and read it today. In addition, I will learn
whatever I can about finances.
4. Today I will have a savings day. Each time that I spend money, I will ask myself: Is it
really necessary?

### Chapter 26. Beneficial Relationships
1. Today I will only surround myself with people who I count as winners. I know thatevery
meeting leaves an impression. I will therefore be very consistent.
2. Today I will pay attention that only beneficial things are played on my "cassette tape."
Iwill only allow myself to be programmed with the positive. For that reason, today, I
willnot watch television. I will take care not to allow myself to be influenced unawares
bythe radio; rather I will consciously choose the music and the motivation cassettes that
Iprefer to hear.
3. I will think about the people I know whom I would emulate. I will find a way to invitethat
person to dinner. Throughout the dinner conversation, I will consciously programmyself as
I see fit. I will have therefore assumed full responsibility for my life and willdesign my
own life.
4. I will make a list of all of the people whom I meet in the course of a month. I willexamine
this list critically and think about which individuals influence me as I desire. Iwill have
the courage to be consistent.

### Chapter 27. Partnership
1. I will think about how I can make my partner stronger. I will ask myself how I can
encourage him or her to develop further.
2. Today I will plan a magic moment. I will think about what my partner especially enjoys
and will organize a surprise. I will take a great deal of effort in planning it and will make
my partner "the happiest person in the world" with it. I will write down a day in my
agenda on which I want to give my partner a magic moment.
3. Today I will give my partner something that makes him or her happy. I will demonstrate to
him or her that he or she is important to me.
4. I will think about the things that my partner does for me that I have possibly taken for
granted. Today I will find a way to thank him or her for them. In addition, I will praise my
partner in detail today at least once.
5. If I do not have a partner, I will make a list of how I feel my ideal partner should be. Most
people do not find their dream partner because they do not know themselves how he or she
should be.

### Chapter 28. Pass It On
1. I will make a list of what I want to pass on to my employees in any case. From now on, I
will concentrate more on duplicating a system. I want to guarantee that all of the
employees in my company know and remember the same basic rules.
2. I want to better ensure that the people who are important to me see what I see, know what I
know and feel what I feel. If someone demonstrates insufficient activities and produces too
weak results, then it is because he does not see the same picture as I. Instead of criticizing,
I will prefer to communicate my vision again.
3. Today I will hold nothing back. I will ensure that every person that I meet today will bestronger and more enriched from the experience.

### Chapter 29. Do It!
1. Today I will begin everything immediately, for I know that it is better to start imperfectly
than to hesitate perfectly.
2. In order to improve my ability to just do it, I will make myself aware again of my reasons
for which I must reach my goals. I will paste symbols of my dreams in my dream album
and look at it as often as possible.
3. I will create a system to control myself. I want to know exactly how consistently I am
acting. If I should determine that I am not demonstrating sufficient activities, then I will
take the time to occupy myself more with my reasons.
4. I will ask myself the question, "What have I made out of my opportunities?"

### Chapter 30. The Present Day is an Opportunity
1. Today I will consciously enjoy the people who enrich my life. I will especially seek outthe proximity of one of these people and spend time with him or her as if I would not see
him or her again for a long time.
2. If I should be in a traffic jam today or be confronted with something adverse, I will
exchange frustration with fascination. The worst thing that can happen to me today is to
have a wonderful day.
3. I will write down 25 things for which I am grateful. By doing this I will love life even
more and feel rich. Today I will use every break to remember even more things for which I
can be thankful and to remember the important things in my life. In this way every time I
have to wait today will be a gift.
4. The present day is as it is. However, I can change my attitude towards it. I will therefore
decide now to regard the present day as an opportunity and to use it as such. Today, I will
consider every single moment as enriching. Every meeting will be a gift. Every minute
will be an opportunity. Every second with a dear one will be a miracle. Today, this day is
my opportunity.

### Chapter 31. There Are Ducks and There Are Eagles...
1. I will decide now to read this book again from cover to cover. One chapter per day.
2. Today, I will look for a quiet place in which I can read the afterword of this book. In it, I
will find an abundance of thoughts upon which I can reflect.
3. I will challenge my environment. I will place high expectations on the people who are
dear to me. By doing this my presence will be rather uncomfortable for some today but I
will make people fly. I will promote and achieve progress.
4. I will make personal notes and start to describe the nature of an eagle. By writing, I will
find access to my own profound thoughts and values. I will realize that there are no
definitive "laws of the winners," but that I have to determine my own laws as the signposts
for my life.
