> The woman that lives next door is a doctor.

##### we use which or that in a relative clause when we are talking about things

##### you must use who/that/which when it is the subject of the relative clause

##### note the position of prepositions (in/to/for etc.) in relative clauses

##### we use whose in relative clauses instead of his/her/their

you can also use whom with a preposition (to whom / from whom / with whom etc.)

##### there are two types of relative clause
**first type**: the relative clauses tell you which person or thing (or what kind of person or thing) the speaker means

> The woman who lives next door is a doctor.

- we do not use commas (,) with these clauses
- you can use that
- you can leave out who/which/that when it is the object

**second type**: we already know which thing or person is meant. the relative clauses in these sentences give us extra information about the person or thing

> My brother Ben, who lives in Hong Kong, is an architect. 

- we use commas (,) with these clauses
- you cannot use that
- you cannot leave out who or which

##### you can use a preposition before whom (for people) and which (for things)
> Mr Lee, to whom I spoke at the meeting, is very interested in our proposal. 

##### in informal English we often keep the preposition after the verb in the relative clause. When we do this, we normally use who (not whom) for people
> This is my friend from Canada, who I was telling you about.

##### you can say all of / most of/ none of / neither of etc. + whom (people) / which (things)
> Helen has three brothers, all of whom are married. 

> Two men, neither of whom I had seen before, came into the office. 

##### you can also say the cause of which I the name of which etc.
> We stayed at a beautiful hotel, the name of which I can't remember now. 

##### which vs what
> Everything that happened was my fault.

> Everything [that/which] they said was true. 

> Joe got the job, which surprised everybody.

in this example, which = 'the fact that he got the job'

> What happened was my fault.

> Did you hear what they said?
