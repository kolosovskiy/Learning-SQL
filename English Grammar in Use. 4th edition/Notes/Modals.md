## Can, could and (be) able to

##### we use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something
> We can see the lake from our hotel.

##### sometimes could is the past of can
> We had a lovely room in the hotel. We could see the lake.

##### you can say that somebody is able to do something
> We are able to see the lake from our hotel.

##### can has only two forms: can (present) and could (past). so sometimes it is necessary to use (be) able to
> I haven't been able to sleep recently.

> Tom might be able to come tomorrow.

##### we use could for general ability. but if you want to say that somebody did something in a specific situation, use was/were able to or managed to. compare:
> Jack was an excellent tennis player when he was younger. He could beat anybody.

> Jack and Andy played a match yesterday. Andy played well, but Jack managed to beat him.

## Could (do) and could have (done)

##### sometimes could is the past of can, but we also use could to talk about possible actions now or in the future
> What shall we do tonight?
>
> We could go to the cinema.

##### we also use could (not can) for actions that are not realistic. compare:
> I can stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)

> Maybe I could stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)

> This is a wonderful place. I could stay here for ever. (unrealistic)

##### we use could have (done) to talk about the past. compare:
> The situation is bad, but it could be worse. (now)

> The situation was bad, but it could have been worse. (past)

##### for the past we use must have (done) and can't have (done)
> I've lost one of my gloves.
>
> You must have dropped it somewhere.

> Tom walked into a wall. He can't have been looking where he was going.

##### you can use couldn't have instead of can't have

> She might know, or She may know.

##### for the past we use may have (done) or might have (done)

>
> She may have been asleep. (= perhaps she was asleep)

##### to talk about possible actions or happenings in the future
> I haven't decided yet where to go on holiday. I may go to Ireland. (= perhaps I will go there)

##### we use only might (not may) when the situation is not real
> If they paid me better, I might work harder. (not I may work)

## Have to and must

##### I have to do something = it is necessary to do it
> I have to wear glasses for reading.

##### we use do/does/did in questions and negative sentences
> What do I have to do to get a new driving licence?

##### must is similar to have to
>

##### mustn't and don't have to are completely different
> You must keep this a secret. You mustn't tell anyone. (= it is necessary that you do not do it)

> You don’t have to tell Tom what happened. I can tell him myself. (= you don't need to do it (but you can if you want))

##### you can use have got to instead of have to.
> I've got to work tomorrow. or I have to work tomorrow.

## Must, mustn't, needn't

##### needn't do or don't need to do something = it's not necessary to do it
> We've got plenty of time. We needn't hurry.

> We don’t need to hurry.

##### needn't have done something = he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary
> Why did he get up at 5 o'clock? He needn't have got up so early.

##### didn't need to do something = it was not necessary to do it. it doesn't matter whether he did it or not
> He didn't need to get up early, so he didn't.

## Should

##### you should do something = it is a good thing to do or the right thing to do
> You look tired. You should go to bed.

##### to say that we expect something to happen

##### you should have done something = you didn't do it, but it would have been the right thing to do
> You missed a great party last night. You should have come.

## Should 2

##### you can use should after
- insist
- recommend
- suggest
- demand
- propose

> I insisted that he should apologise.

##### also you can use should in it's important/vital/necessary/essential that ... should ...
> It's essential that everyone should be here on time.

##### you can also leave out should in this cases. this form is called the subjunctive
> I insisted that he apologise.

> It's essential that everyone be here on time.

you can also use normal present and past tenses

> It's essential that everyone is here on time.

> I insisted that he apologised.

##### after suggest, you cannot use to
> What do you suggest we should do?

> What do you suggest we do?

You can also use -ing after suggest.

> What do you suggest doing?

##### you can say 'if something should happen'/'should something happen'.
> We have no jobs at present, but if the situation should change, we will contact you.

> Should the situation change, we will contact you.

this means the same as ‘if the situation changes...'. with should, the speaker feels that the possibility is smaller.

##### to give somebody advice
> Shall I leave now?
>
> No, I should wait a bit.

Here, I should wait = I would wait if i were you, I advise you to wait.

## Had better, It's time...

##### I had better (usually I'd better) do something = it is advisable to do it
> I have to meet Amy in ten minutes. I'd better go now or I'll be late.

> We'd better stop for petrol soon. The tank is almost empty.

##### had better is similar to should, but not exactly the same. we use had better only for a specific situation, not for things in general:
> It's late. You'd better go. / You should go. (a specific situation - both are possible)

> You're always at home. You should go out more often. (in general - only should is possible)

Also, with had better, there is always a danger or a problem if you don't follow the advice.

> The film starts at 8.30. You'd better go now or you'll be late.

##### you can say it's time (for somebody) to
> It's time to go home. / It's time for us to go home.

##### when we use it's time + past (we went / I did / they were etc.), the meaning is present, not past:
> It's late. It's time we went home.

It's time somebody did something = they should have already done it or started it. we often use this structure to criticise or to complain

> This situation can't continue. It's time you did something about it.

You can also say It's about time ... . This makes the criticism stronger

> Jack is a great talker. But it’s about time he did something instead of just talking.

## Would
##### we use would ('d) / wouldn't when we imagine a situation or action
> It would be nice to buy a new car, but we can't afford it.

##### we use would have (done) when we imagine situations or actions in the past
> They helped us a lot. I don’t know what we'd have done without their help.

##### to express the idea that in the past you thought something would happen in the future
> Tom said he'd call me on Sunday.

##### somebody wouldn't do something = he/she refused to do it
> The car wouldn't start. (= it ‘refused’ to start)

compare with

> The car won't start. (= it 'refuses' to start)

##### to talk about things that happened regularly in the past
> Whenever Richard was angry, he would walk out of the room. (He did it regularly)

very similar to used to

> Helen, will you do me a favour?

##### to ask for something, we use can/could/may I have/get ... ?
