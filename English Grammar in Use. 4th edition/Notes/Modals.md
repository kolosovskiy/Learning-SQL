## Can, could and (be) able to

##### we use can to say that something is possible or allowed, or that somebody has the ability to do something

##### sometimes could is the past of can
> We had a lovely room in the hotel. We could see the lake.

##### you can say that somebody is able to do something
> We are able to see the lake from our hotel.

##### can has only two forms: can (present) and could (past). so sometimes it is necessary to use (be) able to
> I haven't been able to sleep recently.

> Tom might be able to come tomorrow.

##### we use could for general ability. but if you want to say that somebody did something in a specific situation, use was/were able to or managed to. compare:
> Jack was an excellent tennis player when he was younger. He could beat anybody.

> Jack and Andy played a match yesterday. Andy played well, but Jack managed to beat him.

## Could (do) and could have (done)

##### sometimes could is the past of can, but we also use could to talk about possible actions now or in the future
> What shall we do tonight?
>
> We could go to the cinema.

##### we also use could (not can) for actions that are not realistic. compare:
> I can stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (realistic)

> Maybe I could stay with Sarah when I go to Paris. (possible, but less sure)

> This is a wonderful place. I could stay here for ever. (unrealistic)

##### we use could have (done) to talk about the past. compare:

> We've got plenty of time. We needn't hurry.

> We don’t need to hurry.

##### needn't have done something = he did it, but now we know that it was not necessary

## Should 2

##### you can use should after
- insist
- recommend
- suggest
- demand
- propose

> I insisted that he should apologise.

##### also you can use should in it's important/vital/necessary/essential that ... should ...
> It's essential that everyone should be here on time.

##### you can also leave out should in this cases. this form is called the subjunctive
> I insisted that he apologise.

> It's essential that everyone be here on time.

you can also use normal present and past tenses

> It's essential that everyone is here on time.

> I insisted that he apologised.

##### after suggest, you cannot use to
> What do you suggest we should do?

> What do you suggest we do?

You can also use -ing after suggest.

> What do you suggest doing?

##### you can say 'if something should happen'/'should something happen'.
> We have no jobs at present, but if the situation should change, we will contact you.

> Should the situation change, we will contact you.

this means the same as ‘if the situation changes...'. with should, the speaker feels that the possibility is smaller.

##### to give somebody advice
