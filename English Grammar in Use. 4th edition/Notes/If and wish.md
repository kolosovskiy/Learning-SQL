## If I do ... and If I did ...

##### first conditional (if + present ... will ...). you can use this form to talk about the present or the future, and you are saying that there is a real chance that the situation will happen
> If we go by bus, it will be cheaper.

##### second conditional (if + past ... would/might/could ...). you can use this form when we imagine something that will not happen, or we don't expect that it will happen
> If we went by bus, it would be cheaper.

> If it stopped raining, we could go out.

we do not normally use would in the if-part of the sentence. but you can use if ... would when you ask somebody to do something:
> I would be grateful if you would let me know your decision as soon as possible.

in the same way we use **I wish + past**. the meaning is present

> I wish I knew Paul's phone number. (= I don't know it and I regret this, I want to know it)

##### third conditional (If + past perfect ... would + have + past participle). to talk about the past
> If I'd (I had) known you were in hospital, I would have gone to see you.

in the same way we use **I wish + past perfect**

> I wish I'd known that Gary was ill. I would have gone to see him.

##### after if and wish, you can use were instead of was
> If I were you, I wouldn't buy that coat. (or If I was you...)

> I wish she were here. (or I wish she was here).

##### you can say 'I wish you luck / all the best / a happy birthday' etc
> I wish you all the best in the future.

But you cannot say 'I wish that something happens'. We use hope in this situation

> I'm sorry you're not well. I hope you feel better soon.

Compare I wish and I hope:
> I wish you a pleasant stay here.

> I hope you have a pleasant stay here.

##### you can say 'I wish (somebody) would (do something)'
It's been raining all day. Tanya doesn't like it. She says:
> I wish it would stop raining.

We use I wish ... would ... to say that we want something to happen. But we do not use I wish would ... to say how we would like things to be.
> I wish Sarah would come.

> I wish Sarah was (or were) here now. (not I wish Sarah would be)
